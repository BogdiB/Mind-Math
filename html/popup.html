        Everything you see regarding SVGs is not done because it's smart and/or simple,
        I know the easy way to do what I'm doing, however, I am stubborn when I want
        to learn how to do something/see if it is possible (I also wanted to use the
        chrome message connection (see ../scripts/svg.js)).

        The reason I am keeping it like this, instead of doing the smart and simple
        solution (not using embed and just pasting the SVG, so I can just switch the
        class with js), is in case some other poor soul wants to know how to do something
        like this in this context (extensions).
